We want all attendees (visitors, speakers, ‚Ä¶) to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. In order to guarantee an enriched experience at DevFest Nantes, we wanted to expose our choices and services allowing you to be included.

## Inclusivity / Accessiblity ü¶æ

### Breastfeeding room ü§±

If you wish, we can provide a dedicated room to pump your milk and store it in a refrigerator. To do so, please contact the DevFest reception so that we can set up a schedule and give you the key to the room. The location of this room will be communicated to you at that time.

<br/>

### People with reduced mobility üßë‚Äçü¶Ω

The Cit√© des Congr√®s is an accessible venue. The rooms have dedicated spaces, the lifts are visible on the map on your badge.

<br/>

### Deaf and Hard of Hearing ü¶ª

Since 2022, DevFest is equipped with a transcription system (velotype) in all conference rooms. The system in place is provided by the company "Les messageurs" and is a human transcription system and systematically available in the language of the conference. We advise you to position yourself in the first rows of the conference room to follow this system more comfortably. We do not offer translation of the transcription and we do not provide this service in the workshop rooms.

### Reserved seats for pregnant women ü§∞

We offer pregnant women the opportunity to reserve seats in the conference rooms. In order to set up this system, we will need you to notify us before the Festival to identify the number of seats to reserve.
